m4acut depends on L-SMASH (https://github.com/l-smash/l-smash).
You need to obtain/build/install it before building m4acut.

Unix-like environment
---------------------

You can build and install m4acut in the following step.

1) autoreconf -i
2) ./configure
3) make
4) sudo make install

Windows, MSVC
-------------

This is much more difficult than building in MinGW.
Even if you want to stick to MSVC, note that L-SMASH cannot be built with MSVC.
You have to build it using MinGW GCC compiler (I don't explain how to do it).
Also, note that static linking between binaries generated by different toolsets
can have potential issues, and at least requires some additional runtime
libs of GCC/MinGW. Dynamic linking should be easier.

Before building m4acut, you have to edit MSVC/m4acut.props as you need.
By default, value of LSMASH_INCLUDE and LSMASH_LIBDIR is not set (nil).
Depending on your environment, you have to set appropriate directory path
so that MSVC can find them.
Also, enumerate libraries in LSMASH_LIB (separator is semicolon).
