m4acut depends on L-SMASH (https://github.com/l-smash/l-smash).
You need to obtain/build/install it before building m4acut.

Unix-like environment
---------------------

You can build and install m4acut in the following step.

1) autoreconf -i
2) ./configure
3) make
4) sudo make install

Windows, MSVC
-------------

First, you have to build L-SMASH.
Since L-SMASH is written in C99, it requires Visual Studio 2013 or later,
otherwise you have to build it in MinGW.

Then, you have to edit MSVC/m4acut.props as you need.
By default, value of LSMASH_INCLUDE and LSMASH_LIBDIR is not set.
Depending on your environment, you have to set appropriate directory path
so that MSVC can find them.
Also, enumerate libraries in LSMASH_LIB (separator is semicolon). If you want
to statically link to L-SMASH build with MinGW, you will need several MinGW
related runtime library here (not recommended). Otherwise, you will only need
lsmash itself.
If you are linking to L-SMASH DLL, LSMASH_API_IMPORTS is required to be set in
LSMASH_CPPFLAGS. Otherwise, remove it and leave LSMASH_CPPFLAGS empty.
